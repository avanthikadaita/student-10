Question 1: What is parallel computing?

Answer: Parallel computing involves using multiple processors or cores simultaneously to execute a program, enabling faster execution and increased efficiency.

Question 2: If a computer has 3 cores, each capable of handling one task with runtimes of 25ms, 632ms, and 100ms, how long will the program take to run?

Answer: The program will take 632ms to run, as it runs at the pace of the slowest task.

Question 3: Is sequential or parallel computing more efficient, and why?

Answer: Parallel computing is generally more efficient due to simultaneous task execution on multiple processors, leading to faster problem-solving. However, challenges like communication overhead exist.

Question 4: What is the term for a network with multiple paths to one destination, enhancing fault tolerance?

Answer: The term is "redundancy."

Question 5: Using the image above (not provided), is the network fault-tolerant?

Answer: Without visualizing the image, it's not possible to determine the fault tolerance of the network.
