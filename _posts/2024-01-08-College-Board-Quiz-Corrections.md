1. The Code Adventure: NumOccurrences

Line 1: Defines the procedure NumOccurrences with parameters wordList and targetWord.
Line 2: Initializes count to 0.
Line 3: Begins a loop for each word in wordList.
Line 4: Resets count to 0 for each word.
Line 5: Checks if the current word is equal to the targetWord.
Line 6: If true, increments count.
Line 7: Returns the final count.
Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In option B, the code segment encounters a logical flaw. It resets count to 0 for each element in wordList, causing the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended count. This is correctly identified in the answer explanation.

2. Math with Codes: Multiply

Line 1: Defines the procedure Multiply with parameters x and y.
Line 2: Initializes count to 0.
Line 3: Initializes result to 0.
Line 4: Starts a loop until count is greater than or equal to y.
Line 5: Adds x to result in each iteration.
Line 6: Increments count.
Line 7: Returns the final result.
Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In option B, when y is initially negative, the loop condition count â‰¥ y is true, so the loop body is never executed. This results in the incorrect output of 0, as correctly identified in the answer explanation.

3. Database Detective: Ignoring Columns

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: To calculate revenue, we need the selling price, genre, and quantity available. The author's name is not necessary for this calculation.

4. Boolean Breakdown: Display True

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In option B, the code correctly displays true. It checks if x OR y is true and then displays x, which is true. This is accurately identified in the answer explanation.

5. Tech for Everyone: Reducing the Digital Divide

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Option D correctly suggests that having world governments support the construction of network infrastructure can help bridge the digital divide. The incorrect choice A is rightly flagged for potentially exacerbating the divide.

6. Grading Mystery: Course Grade Calculation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Option A correctly calculates the course grade by summing up the scores and dividing by the number of assignments, ensuring the lowest score is dropped.

7. Sharing Games: Acceptable Sharing Conditions

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Option C correctly states that sharing is acceptable when the student gets permission from the copyright owner. This aligns with copyright ethics, whereas the incorrect choice D is identified as violating copyright.

8. Colors in Computers: RGB Triplets

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Option B correctly identifies that the binary RGB triplet (11111111, 11111111, 11100000) corresponds to the color "Light yellow."

9. Circuit Magic: Output of a Logic Circuit

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Option C correctly identifies the input values that will result in a true output from the circuit. The incorrect choice B is accurately flagged as producing a false output.

10. Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In option D, the code adeptly simulates a game where a player flips a fair coin three times. The condition checks for the sum of the coin flips, ensuring a win only when all flips result in the same outcome. Option D emerges as the correct choice for an accurate simulation of the coin game.
