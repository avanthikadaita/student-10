    "   Your selection: A, C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Correct Answer: A, C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation: Option A correctly simulates the spinner's behavior by using nested IF statements to determine which region to display based on the outcome of random number generation. Option C also correctly simulates the spinner's behavior, but it assigns a random value to the variable \"spin\" before determining which region to display based on the value of \"spin\". Both options properly handle the probabilities associated with each region of the spinner.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Your selection: C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Correct Answer: C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explanation: Option C correctly addresses the issue with the program's logic. By interchanging lines 8 and 12, the procedure will return true if it completes the loop without encountering a value less than the preceding value, indicating that the list is indeed increasing. If such a value is encountered during the loop, it will return false, indicating that the list is not increasing as intended."
